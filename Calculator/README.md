# Simple Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program written in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operation. It then performs the specified operation and displays the result.

## Usage
1. Compile the `calculator.java` file using a Java compiler.

```bash
javac calculator.java
```
2. Run the compiled Java program.
```bash
java calculator
```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions:
- Enter the first number.
- Enter the second number.
- Enter the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /, %, ^).
For example:

```
4. The program will output the result of the arithmetic operation.
## Supported Operations
- Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
- Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
- Division (/): Divides the first number by the second number.
- Modulus (%): Computes the remainder when dividing the first number by the second number.
- Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
## Example
```
Enter first number:
10
Enter second number:
